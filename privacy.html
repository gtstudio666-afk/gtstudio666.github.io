<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>2.1 Information Collected Directly by the Game</h3>
<p>
<strong>We do not directly collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.</strong>
The Game is an offline single-player game. All game progress and data are stored locally on your device only.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Information Collected by Third-Party Services</h3>
<p>
The Game uses third-party advertising services provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>.
In order to provide and optimize advertisements (including personalized ads),
AdMob may automatically collect and use certain information, including but not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (such as Advertising ID)</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Approximate location (based on IP address)</li>
    <li>Ad interaction and usage data</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Please note:</strong> We do not have access to or control over the data collected by AdMob.
Google AdMob is solely responsible for its data processing practices, which are governed by its own privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
You may reset your advertising ID or limit ad personalization through your device system settings.
This may affect the type of ads you see.

<h2>3. User Consent</h2>

    <li><strong>Agree:</strong> Personalized ads may be shown based on collected information.</li>
    <li><strong>Disagree:</strong> Only non-personalized ads will be shown.</li>

Your choice affects advertising only and does not impact the core gameplay experience.
</p>

<h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>
We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information without your consent,
please contact us immediately.
If we discover that personal information has been collected from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent,
we will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>
Although we do not directly collect personal data, we take user privacy seriously.
We encourage users to manage advertising preferences through their device settings.
</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data.
Since we do not directly store your data, any requests related to data collected by AdMob
should be directed to Google or handled through your device settings.
